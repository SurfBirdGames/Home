## PRIVACY POLICY FOR MOBILE APPLICATION

**Surf Bird Games, november 2019, version V1**

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application **AI Pipe** (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by **Surf Bird Games**. 

The Application is a single player, turn based, board type, puzzle game in which the player competes with the computer artificial intelligence (AI). The aim of the game is to connect two opposing sides of the board by placing tiles with pipe sections on the board thus creating a continuous pipe network from one side to the other. The player needs to connect the left- and right hand side of the board, the computer AI needs to connect the top- and bottom sides of the board.
There are two game modes: 
1. **First connect**: either party – player or computer AI – that makes the first full connection from one side of the board to the opposite side wins. As the player always has the first move, the computer AI has the last move. If both parties create a full connection in the same turn, then the party with the highest connection score wins. If connection scores are equal the game ends in a draw. First connect results in short duration games.
2. **Last move**: the game ends when the board is (almost) full and the next upcoming tile – player or computer AI - cannot be placed anymore. The winner of the game is the party with the highest connection score. Last move results in longer duration games.

Two types of edge connections can be made: normal connections valued at one (1) point and special connections valued at two (2) points. Special connections are marked with a dot on the board edges.

The connection score is calculated as follows: sum all connection points at one side and multiply this number with the sum of all connection points on the opposing side.

There are three difficulty modes: easy, medium and not- so-easy. The easy and medium modes are provided with a hint and tack-back functionality. On the not-so-easy mode these functions are disabled.

Two types of games can be played:
1. Casual mode: a random set of tiles is generated and distributed to player and computer AI.
2. Tournament mode: fifty (50) pre-defined levels consisting of a collection of fifty (50) pre-sorted tile sets with increasing difficulty needs to be won by the player to complete all. In the not-so-easy mode level scores are uploaded to an on-line leader board allowing players to rank themselves with other players.
